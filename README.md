# Portfolio - Practicing Express with TypeScript

This repository is part of my portfolio and is dedicated to practicing Express with TypeScript. Here, I am exploring and learning how to develop web applications using these technologies.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to gain experience and become familiar with the following technologies and concepts:

- Express: A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- TypeScript: A typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- Developing backend web applications using TypeScript and Express.

## Repository Contents

The repository contains the source code of a sample application developed with Express and TypeScript. You will find the following main folders and files:

- `src/`: This folder contains the source code of the application.
- `src/index.ts`: The entry point of the Express application.
- `src/routes/`: This folder holds the route definitions and controllers of the application.
- `src/models/`: Folder containing the data models used in the application.
- `package.json`: npm configuration file with the necessary dependencies and scripts.
